# David R. – Final Portfolio Project

## About Me
Hi! My name is David, and I'm a junior at Mt. Eden High School. I'm currently taking AP Computer Science Principles. This class has taught me key programming concepts like variables, arrays, loops, and functions, as well as how to build web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy creating projects that are both fun and challenging. Outside of coding, I like wrestling, hiking, spending time with friends, and listening to music by artists like The Marías and Mac DeMarco.

## About This Project
This portfolio website is my final project for AP Computer Science Principles. It shows who I am, what I’ve learned throughout the year, and the projects I’ve created in class. Making this site, it has made me have a better understanding of programming and it has improved my coding skills.

## What’s Included in the Portfolio Site
- **Home Page** – A welcome message and intro to the site  
- **About Me** – Personal interests and background information    
- **My Projects** – Descriptions and links to class projects  

## Featured Projects
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  A classic two-player game where players take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The first player to line up three symbols in a row wins. It's competitive, fun, and easy to play.

- **Clock App**  
  A digital clock that displays the current time in real time and allows the user to change the background color. It’s a useful app that shows working with time and user input.

- **Red Light Green Light**  
  This game challenges players to move only when the light is green. If the player moves while the light is red, the game ends. It’s a fun game that you could take turns playing with friends.
