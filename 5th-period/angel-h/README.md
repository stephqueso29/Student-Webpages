## About Me

Hi, I'm Angel H, a student developer with a growing passion for web development. This year, I've focused on building interactive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy creating fun, functional projects that show off what I've learned.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is the final project for my web development course. It showcases the skills I've developed throughout the year and includes some of my favorite projects. Through this work, I've learned how to write clean code, build interactive features, and design responsive layouts.

## What's Included in My Portfolio

- A responsive, mobile-friendly layout
- A homepage with navigation and project previews
- A section containing personal information
