# Final Portfolio Project â€“ Gavin L.

## About Me

Hello! I'm Gavin L., a student at Mt. Eden High School with a growing interest in computer science and mathematics. Iâ€™m currently exploring different paths in tech and considering pursuing a degree in a related field at a four-year university. This portfolio represents not only my technical work but also my progress and curiosity as a student developer.

## What This Project Is

This is my final portfolio project for the year, and it showcases several interactive programs and games Iâ€™ve built using languages like C++ and JavaScript. Through this course, Iâ€™ve learned the fundamentals of programming, how to build user interfaces, and the importance of collaboration in development. My problem-solving skills have grown significantly, and Iâ€™ve gained a solid foundation in creating functional, engaging digital experiences.

## Portfolio Overview

My portfolio website includes:

- A visually styled homepage with sections for navigation
- A detailed **About Me** section
- A summary of key **Things I Learned** during the year
