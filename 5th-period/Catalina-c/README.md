## About Me

Welcome to my personal website! My name is Catalina Chavez. I am 16 years old and I go to Mt.Eden High School. I am currently a junior taking a computer science course for the first time. This class has shown me how to problem solve and work through challenges of fixing bugs and errors in code. I have worked passed these roadblocks and created projects that showcase what I have learned this year. As you go through my website you can see and test out some of my personal projects that I have worked on throughout the year. Each project has helped me learn new key components that are essential to understanding the basics of coding. Some topics I further learned about throughout this year about were loops, nested loops, data types, arrays, and much more!

## Project Overview

This website contains my portfolio and description about who I am as a programmer. Through this website I share my journey throughout this year in AP Computer Science. This website holds various of my projects worked on throughout this school year, here is my description on each project and an explanation for each project's purpose. -

Memory Game -For this project I worked in a team of three to complete the code. We obtained this project from a tutorial to understand more of the fundamentals on how to create a game in Javascript. We also used HTML and CSS to help us design the project and create a neat structure. The aim for this memory card game is to let the user utilize their brain skills to remember a card they flipped before hand and check a different card to see if they make a match. This game is a great way to test your skills and build a stronger brain that can retain and remember more information.

Learn your ABC's! - This project is an educational alphabet game. With the help of my group, we applied what fundamentals we learned from the matching game to create our own game with our own idea. Our idea was to create a game that could help kids learn their ABC's, Users are able to learn the order of the letters in the alphabet and the difference between uppercase & lowercase letters. This game was done with javascript, CSS, and HTML.

Poem & Quote Generator - This project is a poem and quote generator. To complete this project I worked with a partner to learn through a tutorial how to create a generator on javascript. Just like the memory card game, we also used our own ideas for our design with CSS and HTML. Additionally we added our own feature to the generator, the poem generator. Test out the generator to randomize various quotes and poems.
