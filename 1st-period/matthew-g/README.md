# Matthew G. - Final Portfolio Project

## 👋 About Me
Hi, my name is Matthew Gutierrez. I’m a high school sophomore and an aspiring developer currently exploring the fundamentals of computer science and programming. Through the AP Computer Science Principles course, I’ve gained hands-on experience with several languages and tools, including C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This class has taught me not only syntax, but how to approach and solve complex programming challenges step by step.

## 💡 About the Project
This portfolio is the final project for my AP Computer Science Principles course. It represents everything I’ve learned over the year — from basic coding concepts to building complete interactive applications. Throughout the course, I’ve developed both technical skills and creative confidence, and this portfolio demonstrates my growth as a developer.

## 📁 What the Portfolio Includes
The portfolio is built with a clean, modern layout and showcases the key projects I’ve completed throughout the year. Each project is presented with a brief description, a link to try the project, and a link to the source code. This site reflects both my coding progress and design thinking.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
🎰 Slot Game
A simulation of a classic slot machine with three spinning wheels. Players cycle through icons like cherries, bananas, and bells, aiming to match symbols and win.

❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe
A two-player version of the classic game where players alternate placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first to line up three in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — wins.

🏓 Pong Game
A modern take on the retro Pong game. Players can choose between single-player and two-player modes with full paddle control and real-time score tracking.
