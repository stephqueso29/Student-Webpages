# Final Portfolio Project – Kobe Nguyen

👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Kobe Nguyen, a sophomore in high school with some interest in computer science and web development. I started learning programming through C++, which helped me understand core coding concepts and logical thinking. This past year, I’ve been focusing on frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy designing interactive websites and challenging myself to explore new tools and technologies as I grow as a developer.

📘 Project Overview

This final portfolio project showcases the progress I’ve made throughout my computer science course. It brings together several projects that demonstrate what I’ve learned about coding, design, logic, and problem-solving. Throughout the year, I gained experience in debugging, working with user input, creating animations, and using GitHub to manage and share my code.

🌐 What My Portfolio Includes

My portfolio site presents my top projects in a clean, organized layout. It highlights:

- An "About Me" section introducing who I am and what I’ve learned
- Project descriptions
- Links to live versions of each project for people to view

🚀 Featured Projects

- **Dino Jump Game**  
  A fun and simple game where players choose a character (dino, turtle, or fish) and jump over obstacles to earn points. This project taught me about collision detection, animations, and game loops in JavaScript.

- **Stopwatch**  
  A digital stopwatch that allows users to start, stop, and reset time. This project helped me understand how JavaScript handles timing functions like `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`.

- **Calculator**  
  A basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Through this project, I learned how to handle user input, update the display dynamically, and structure logical operations with JavaScript.
