      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Shreya Rathaur and I am a senior at Mount Eden High School. I have never imagined myself pursuing Computer Science or any field related to computers, software engineering, or coding, however, when I got the opportunity to take the AP Computer Science Principles Course this year, I decided not to pass it up. Though this year has been difficult, challenging, and confusing, I have learned a great deal from C++ to HTML and JavaScript. Thanks to Mr. Alvarado, we were all able to get out what we were seeking from this class, whether it was to test the waters with something we have never tried before, or to gain experience in something we would like to pursue. Coming in with absolutely no knowledge of coding, I feel proud of myself for learning key concepts of coding such as functions, arrays, and more. I am also extremely grateful to Mr. Alvarado for teaching us so well even though it is his first time as a high school instructor. Coming out of this class, I feel confident that I have gained another skill that could possibly help me down the road in this technologically advancing world. </p>

          <h3>Cat Meme Generator</h3>
          <p>This is a Cat Meme Generator. The user has the option to choose out of four different emotions and with that input, the code displays a meme of a cat relevant to that emotion. In addition, each array for each cat meme emotion has multiple memes, thus the same emotion can be reclicked to display different memes of cats with the same desired emotion.</p>

          <p>This is a Matching Game. In this game, the user can click on two boxes to make them turn around. Only two boxes can be turned around at one time, therefore, the user has to remember which emoji was on which box. Through this, the user will need to turn the corresponding boxes to create a match.</p>
