# Shreya R. – Final Project Portfolio

## 👋 About Me
Hi! I'm Shreya Rather, a student developer who has learned about design, web development, and building creative projects this year! I would like to showcase what I've learned, and this portfolio is a reflection of my growth. This year I have learned many concepts that are applicable to many languages of coding. Starting the year of with learning C++ and ending this year with learning HTML and JavaScript has challenged me in many ways, however, it has developed my understanding of computer science as well. All these projects I am about to present contain concepts Mr. Alvarado has taught us this year- including if, else statements, loops, arrays, and much more.

## 🌐 About the Project & What I learned
This website is a personal portfolio that includes an About Me section introducing who I am and what I do, as well as a Project Gallery showcasing the projects I’ve built this year. It features a clean and modern design that reflects my personal style and includes fully responsive and functional links to live project demos. Throughout the year, I’ve learned to build and style web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, debug and enhance interactive features, and use version control with Git while deploying websites through GitHub Pages.
