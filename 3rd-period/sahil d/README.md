# Final Portfolio Project ‚Äì Sahil D.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Sahil D., a passionate and curious student developer with a growing interest in web development, design, and problem-solving. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code and continuously learning new technologies to improve my skills. This portfolio represents the progress I‚Äôve made as a developer and showcases the work I‚Äôve done throughout the year.

## Project Overview

This portfolio project is the culmination of everything I‚Äôve learned during the academic year. It showcases my development journey, from foundational concepts to fully functional web applications. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control with Git. I also learned how to effectively present my work online and reflect on the design and technical choices I made in each project.

## What's Included

My portfolio site is a personalized, responsive website that features:

- A clean and accessible layout
- A professional introduction section
- A gallery of my featured projects with descriptions
- Navigation that makes it easy to explore
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
- Links to my GitHub and other relevant pages

## Featured Projects
