# Final Portfolio – by Ainoa H.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Ainoa H., a student developer who enjoys building fun, interactive web experiences. Over the past year, I've developed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning how to bring ideas to life through code. I’m especially drawn to projects that combine creativity with logic, and I enjoy experimenting with animation, layout, and user interaction.

## Project Overview
This portfolio site is the final project of my web development coursework. It showcases a collection of the projects I've built throughout the year and highlights my growth as a front-end developer. Through this experience, I've learned not only how to write cleaner and more efficient code, but also how to design with purpose, structure a site clearly, and bring personality to every project I share.

## What's Included in the Portfolio Site
- A pastel purple-themed design with a consistent, modern layout
- A responsive structure for desktop and mobile viewing
- A homepage with a brief introduction
- A featured projects section with visual previews and summaries
- Links to each project’s live version and GitHub code

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Dino Game**
A browser-based runner game inspired by the classic Chrome Dino. Built with JavaScript, it features jump mechanics, obstacle collision, and an increasing difficulty level.

### 2. **Flappy Bird Clone**
A recreation of the popular Flappy Bird game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game includes smooth animations, collision detection, and a scoring system.

### 3. **Quote Generator**
This project dynamically displays random quotes using JavaScript. It fetches data from an API and allows users to copy or share quotes, with a clean and minimal design.

### 4. **Hangman**
A web version of the classic word guessing game. Users try to guess a hidden word letter by letter, with visual feedback and error tracking. Built using DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic.

### 5. **Final Portfolio Website**
This portfolio site ties everything together, reflecting my design choices, technical skills, and creative growth. It serves as a personal hub for showcasing my work and progress.
