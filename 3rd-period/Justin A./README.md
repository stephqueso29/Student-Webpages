# Justin A.
Hi, I'm Justin A., a student at mt eden who took Ap comp sci my junior year

This portfolio site is the final project of my AP Computer Science Principles class. It's a collection of everything I’ve worked on and learned this year, from writing HTML and CSS to exploring interactivity with JavaScript. Along the way, I’ve improved my problemsolving skills, learned to debug code efficiently, and started thinking like a real web developer.

Featured Projects
Tic Tac Toe
A simple, classic two-player game where users take turns trying to get three in a row. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 Minesweeper
A remix project that challenges players to clear the board without hitting a mine. It helped me learn about logic, grids, and if/else statements.

 CPS Clicker
A fun “clicks per second” game that tests your reaction speed and tracks how fast you can go. I added some custom style and animations to make it more exciting.
