        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm <strong>Alexandre Barragan</strong>, a Junior at Mt. Eden High School.
            This site showcases my AP Computer Science projects. Throughout the year,
            I've worked with C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This site is built primarily
            with HTML and CSS. I would also like to thank Mr. Gary Alvarado for teaching me along this journey.
        </p>

            <div class="description">Minesweeper was my last project I can show off. 
             I worked with 2 other people for this project, being Justin (again) and Nathaniel.
             This was probably the hardest to get done, and remember don't step on a bomb!</div>
