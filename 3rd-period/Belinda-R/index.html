      <!-- Add about me  -->
      Hello! I'm Belinda Rivera Molina. I live in Hayward, California.I am a senior about to graduate in less than a week. My birthday was last year in Decemeber 4,2006. I am getting an internship this summer right after school ends with an Company called 1856 Productions, what they do is do customs t-shirst store and focus on marketing their products and learning the business concept of their family owned business. This fall I would be going to University of California, Riverside which is pretty exciting. GO HIGHLANDERS ðŸ’™ðŸ’›!! I would be majoring in business economics might switch it depending if I like it or not into business admistration. As being in this class as an AP COMP SCI student it was a mix of emotions learning coding more advanced and in a fast pace. Would might continue in college or learn more about it later on.
