      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        What up what up! My name is Kody Nguyen and I am a junior at Mt. Eden High School learning the fundamentals of computer science. Throughout the year, I have learned how to use multiple programming languages and structure them accordingly. Although at first it was challenging beginning with C++ with a new teacher, I eventually adapted to creating functions, loops, and much more. Similarly, when Java and HTML were first introduced to me, I have become well equipped over time. Below reveals my proudest projects this year that display my skills within the field!

        <h3>Project 1: Pong Game</h3>
        <a href="pong.html" class="project-link">Play Pong Game!</a>
        <img src="ponggame.png" alt="Screenshot of Pong arcade game interface" />
        <p>
          This game was my first project for this class. I followed a YouTube tutorial on how to make the pong arcade game using strictly HTML and Java. Click on the link to test it out!

        <h3>Project 2: Cookie Clicker</h3>
        <a href="cookie.html" class="project-link">Get to clicking!</a>
        <img src="cookie.png" alt="Screenshot of Cookie Clicker game interface" />
        <p>
          This was the third project for this class and it was a group assignment. We were not allowed to follow any tutorials and had limited outside help. This game is a cookie clicker replica with ranks and upgrades like an autoclicker and double clicks, all created using HTML, CSS, and Java. Try it above!

        <h3>Project 3: Guess The Number Game</h3>
        <a href="number.html" class="project-link">GUESS THAT NUMBAA!</a>
        <img src="number.png" alt="Screenshot of Guess The Number game interface" />
        <p>
          This game was my final project for this class and was completed solo without outside help. I used HTML, CSS, and Java to make this game and turned it into the College Board. When playing, there are two separate game modes: one where you can pick the secret number, and one where it is computer-generated. After you guess a random number from 1-100, it will tell you whether it is higher or lower until the correct number is submitted. Click the link to test it out!
