👋 About Me
Hello! My name is Gurman B, and I am a junior currently learning the principles of computer science. This year has been both challenging and rewarding—I’ve grown so much as a coder and problem solver. From the basics of programming to building interactive websites, I’ve gained a solid foundation in coding. I’m excited to showcase my skills and the projects I’ve worked on throughout the year!

🗂️ Overview
Welcome to my digital portfolio! This collection highlights the work I've done over the school year, starting from simple HTML projects, advancing through CSS designs, and finishing with interactive JavaScript apps. Over time, I learned how to write cleaner, more efficient code and how to make my designs more user-friendly and visually appealing. You'll see a variety of creations—from fun games to helpful tools.

💻 Projects
Here are just a few of the awesome things I built:

🎨 Color Switcher Game – A fun game where you change background colors using buttons or auto-mode. Great for learning event listeners!

🖼️ Image Slider – A smooth and responsive image carousel that shows off photos or content. Learned about arrays and dynamic DOM manipulation.

🕒 Digital Clock – A real-time digital clock that updates every second. This taught me how to work with Date objects and intervals in JavaScript.
